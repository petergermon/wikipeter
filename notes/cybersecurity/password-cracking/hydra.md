# Hydra
Hydra is a powerful and popular tool that is pre-installed in Kali Linux. It is a network logon cracker that can brute-force various protocols like FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP, and many others. Its primary purpose is to find weak passwords by systematically trying different combinations.

Hydra's syntax is as follows:
`hydra -L <userlist> -P <passwordlist> <target> <protocol>`
